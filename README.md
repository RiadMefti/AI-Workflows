# MCP-Server-Client

Small TypeScript library of learning examples inspired by "Building Effective Agents" (Anthropic). This is a collection of tiny adapters and ideas meant for experimentation and study.

What it does (short):

- Provides thin LLM adapters so you can swap providers (OpenAI, Mistral, etc.).
- Shows simple workflow patterns to experiment with agent-like behavior.
